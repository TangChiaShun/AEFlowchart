# AEFlowchart

**Sketch plugin for fast and convenient creation of flowchart diagrams**

> Basically, you add some text labels, convert them to appropriate flowchart shapes and then connect them.  
Oh, and you can also customize the look very much via [settings](http://tadija.net/projects/AEFlowchart/AEFlowchart-Settings.png).
